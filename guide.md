### 2.2 Building Executables and Libraries
- [ ] Create executables with `executable()`
- [ ] Build static libraries with `static_library()`
- [ ] Build shared libraries with `shared_library()`
- [ ] Use `both_libraries()` for convenience
- [ ] Link libraries with executables

### 2.3 Header Files and Include Directories
- [ ] Manage include directories with `include_directories()`
- [ ] Handle public vs private headers
- [ ] Use `install_headers()` for library distribution
- [ ] Configure header search paths

**Milestone**: Build a multi-file project with separate library and executable

## Phase 3: Dependencies and Configuration (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 External Dependencies
- [ ] Find system libraries with `dependency()`
- [ ] Handle optional dependencies
- [ ] Use `find_library()` for manual library detection
- [ ] Work with pkg-config dependencies
- [ ] Handle dependency versions and requirements

### 3.2 Configuration Files
- [ ] Generate config headers with `configure_file()`
- [ ] Use `configuration_data()` for templating
- [ ] Handle compiler feature detection
- [ ] Create version information files
- [ ] Manage build-time constants

### 3.3 Compiler and Linker Options
- [ ] Set compiler flags globally and per-target
- [ ] Handle different compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- [ ] Configure linker options
- [ ] Use compiler checks and feature detection
- [ ] Handle debug vs release builds

**Milestone**: Create a configurable library that detects system features

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 7-8)

### 4.1 Cross-Compilation
- [ ] Understand cross-compilation concepts
- [ ] Create cross-compilation files
- [ ] Handle target-specific dependencies
- [ ] Configure toolchains for different architectures
- [ ] Test cross-compiled binaries

### 4.2 Testing Framework
- [ ] Write unit tests with Meson's test framework
- [ ] Use `test()` function effectively
- [ ] Organize test suites
- [ ] Configure test environments
- [ ] Generate test coverage reports

### 4.3 Installation and Packaging
- [ ] Configure installation with `install` parameter
- [ ] Use `install_data()` and `install_man()`
- [ ] Handle installation directories
- [ ] Create distribution packages
- [ ] Configure installation permissions

**Milestone**: Create a complete project with tests, documentation, and installation

## Phase 5: Expert Level (Week 9-10)

### 5.1 Custom Targets and Generators
- [ ] Create custom build rules with `custom_target()`
- [ ] Use generators for repetitive tasks
- [ ] Handle code generation workflows
- [ ] Integrate external tools in build process
- [ ] Create reusable build components

### 5.2 Subprojects and Wrap Dependencies
- [ ] Manage subprojects with `subproject()`
- [ ] Use WrapDB for dependency management
- [ ] Create custom wrap files
- [ ] Handle fallback dependencies
- [ ] Organize large multi-project builds

### 5.3 Advanced Scripting
- [ ] Use Python modules in Meson
- [ ] Create custom Meson modules
- [ ] Handle complex build logic
- [ ] Integrate with external build systems
- [ ] Optimize build performance

### 5.4 Platform-Specific Features
- [ ] Windows-specific configurations
- [ ] macOS framework handling
- [ ] Linux distribution packaging
- [ ] Mobile platform considerations
- [ ] Embedded system builds

**Milestone**: Contribute to an open-source project using Meson or convert an existing project

## Phase 6: Mastery Projects (Week 11-12)

### Choose one or more projects to demonstrate mastery:

#### Project A: Multi-Language Library
- [ ] Create a library with C/C++ core and Python bindings
- [ ] Handle multiple programming languages
